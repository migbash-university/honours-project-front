## Description

This is an Edinburgh Napier University Honours Project for (BSc.) Computer Science Degree. 

This Honours Project revolves around Conversational A.I. Agents to be used in the Educational System for the correct interaction with humans to pass across knowledge. However, due to the lack of existing real-world literature and research on `multi-modal` learning approaches, such as: visual - audio and interactive charts methods of learning, this honours project aims to understand the imapct of the use of a Conversational A.I. Agent to pass across knowledge to the user on a scientific topic and companre it with standard and more common methods of learning.

This repository is only half-of the project. It focuses on the development of the `conversational AI` agent and the outline of its development. The `UI/UX` in a web-app format can be accessed on the following link -> [insert-link-here] and for the open-source code for it can be found here -> [insert-link-here]

## Developemnt

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
